# PSIFramePlus
This is enhanced iframe utility component to embed other page/site inside Salesforce. It was primarily built to show a Tableau viz inside Salesforce as there was not specific Lightning Web Component for iframes. I also added ability to automatically scale the Tableau viz if the size of the component changes based on stretching/shrinking the browser window. So the Tableau via will grow and shrink in size instead of rolling off the page and having typical iframe scroll bars.

Here are the main configuration options
